Be extremely relatable by sharing something uncomfortable about yourself that a lot of people could sympathize with. Willingness to share openly builds trust and respect, and often creates a loyal following.

## Structure

1. Start by admitting a weakness or describing an embarrassing situation you found yourself in
2. Tell the honest, raw truth about how you feel and what you're struggling with
3. Turn it into a positive insight or lesson learned (the goal is to inspire, not garner sympathy)

## Example

"I'm afraid to admit this, but I feel super insecure every time I go to make a video. I have this feeling like everyone is going to judge how I look, how I speak, how I express myself. I feel dreadful when I get a negative comment, and sometimes it makes me want to quit this forever and go get a regular job. I don't think people realize how hard it is to be in the public eye. We might get on here and look like everything is fine, but no one knows the struggles we go through behind the scenes. Everyone is fighting a hidden battle, so please, let's be kind to each other."

## Persuasion at Work

- **Sensory Language**: Use specific details from the experience. "My hands were shaking before I hit record" lands harder than "I was nervous."
- **Situational Relatability**: Describe the exact situation so they see themselves in it. The more specific you are, the more universal it feels.
