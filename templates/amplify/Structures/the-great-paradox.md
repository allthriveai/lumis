Change someone's perspective by showing the paradoxical or counter-intuitive nature of something. Often the answers to our problems are the opposite of what we expect. Highlight these counter-intuitive solutions to shift belief and give hope.

## Structure

1. Start by stating the problem or telling a story of struggle
2. Imply or state the false belief you or someone else had (how you thought something would solve the problem but it didn't)
3. Explain the moment of realization when your belief was changed
4. Explain how the new way of thinking/doing solved the problem and/or made you feel better
5. Optional call to action

## Example

"For years I struggled with depression. I wanted so badly to be free of it. So I began studying personal development and reading dozens of self-help books in an attempt to cure myself. Things changed on the outside, but the depression remained. In a bout of pure despair, I cried out 'WHY?' In that moment, something within me said, 'Just surrender.' And my tears of sadness suddenly turned to tears of joy as I realized that the very reason for so much of my struggle was my belief that struggle itself was the answer."

## Persuasion at Work

- **Curiosity Gap**: The paradox itself is an open loop. People cannot walk away from a contradiction until they see how it resolves.
- **Cognitive Ease**: State the paradox simply in one sentence, then unpack it. If the setup needs re-reading, simplify it.
