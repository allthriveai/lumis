Report on events, discoveries, or observations. Instead of positioning yourself as the "expert" you act like a reporter who gathers information and provides it in an easy-to-consume format. Perfect for beginners looking to gain a following without pretending to be an expert.

## Structure

1. State the event/observation/source of discovery and what the viewer is going to learn or how they'll benefit from it
2. Report on the facts, learnings, or observations
3. Relate it back to your own life or a common struggle when possible
4. Optional call to action: follow you for more on this topic

## Example

"I read this amazing book the other day called 'The Dream Giver' and here are the 3 biggest takeaways. 1. If you have a dream, it means its possible, otherwise that dream wouldn't have been given to you. 2. Don't share your dreams with others because most will only plant seeds of doubt in you. 3. There will be several tests and challenges along the way. These are not meant to make you quit. They are meant to prepare you for the next level. I know I've struggled immensely with self-doubt, but this book helped me to believe in myself more."

## Persuasion at Work

- **Cognitive Ease**: Report facts simply. Do not overcomplicate what the source said. Your job is to translate, not impress.
- **Foundational Principles**: Strip away trends and report on what holds true regardless of context. Timeless ideas earn trust faster than hot takes.
