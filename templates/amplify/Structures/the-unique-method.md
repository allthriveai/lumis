Spark curiosity by presenting a unique way of solving a problem and giving it a unique name. Organizing ideas into named systems makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts. Ideas capture more attention for longer when they have a name.

## Structure

- How to [achieve specific result] in [specific time frame] using [unique method]
- How I [solved specific problem] using [unique method]
- How you can [get specific result] using the power of [unique method]
- This [unique method] took me from [undesirable state] to [desired outcome]

## Example

"How I dissolved my social anxiety using the power of Neuro-Feedback Mechanisms"

"How to increase your results with paid advertising using the C.A.L.M Scaling Method"

"How learning my Love Language transformed my relationship."

## Persuasion at Work

- **Put a Fence Around It**: Name the method, define its boundaries, and make it a bounded concept. A named system feels more real than a list of tips.
- **Visual Frameworks**: Turn the method into a diagram, acronym, or named system. People remember shapes and names, not paragraphs.
