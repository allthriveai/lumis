Describe what happens if someone doesn't change. People don't change unless the pain of staying the same becomes uncomfortable enough. Make the cost of doing nothing vivid.

## Structure

1. Talk about the current less-than-desirable state and how momentum will make it worse over time
2. Tell a personal story about how this happened in your own life
3. Talk about the often overlooked signs that things are heading in the wrong direction
4. Paint the picture of how painful the future scenario will be if they don't change now
5. Explain how there is a solution that guarantees growth instead of decay
6. Call to action to learn more

## Example

"You're getting by in your relationship, but it's kind of 'meh.' Everything seems fine for the most part, but it's not exactly what you dreamed of when you first got into it, is it? You may exist in this state of 'meh' for a while, but a relationship that isn't improving is decaying. I learned that the hard way. Everything seemed okay in my relationship, and then BAM, everything we were sweeping under the rug came to the surface all at once. It nearly destroyed us. What doesn't get addressed now will come back to bite you later."

## Persuasion at Work

- **Loss Aversion**: The pain of staying the same outweighs the pleasure of changing. Frame it as what they lose, not what they gain.
- **Urgency**: Make the cost time-sensitive. "Eventually" does not motivate. "By this time next year" does.
- **Compounding Consequences**: Small inaction today equals massive cost later. Show the math so they feel the weight of waiting.
