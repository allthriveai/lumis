Illustrate a concept by comparing it to a natural, universal law. The analogy paints a picture that helps people understand on a deeper level than a plain statement.

## Structure

1. State the concept you want to teach or explain
2. Compare it to a natural law: [natural phenomenon like a river, seasons, gravity, seeds growing, evaporation]
3. Show how fighting the natural law creates resistance: "[what happens when your audience fights the current approach]"
4. Show how working with the natural law creates flow: "[what happens when they align with the better approach]"
5. Land the lesson: the concept works the same way as the natural law

## Additional metaphor sources

- Growth/change of a tree, flower, seasons, or animal
- Speed, cycles, or stages of growth
- Flow, evaporation, condensation of water
- Emergence of a tree from a seed
- Sowing and reaping, giving and receiving
- Decay and regrowth, death and rebirth
- Laws of physics: gravity, momentum, inertia

## Example

"Success in your meditation practice is like a river. The more you fight the current, the harder it is. Fighting the current is like trying to change your thoughts or force your mind to be quiet. The harder you try, the harder it becomes to achieve your aim. Instead, go with the current. Simply observe the mind and body without trying to change anything about it. Total acceptance dissolves the resistance that keeps thought forms alive."

## Persuasion at Work

- **Familiarity**: Connect the unfamiliar concept to something they already understand from nature. A river, a seed, gravity. The known carries the unknown.
- **Cognitive Ease**: The metaphor does the explaining for you. If you still need a long explanation after the metaphor, pick a better metaphor.
