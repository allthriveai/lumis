Peak curiosity using emotional storytelling. Start in the middle of the story, at the point of highest drama. The story should have an element of redemption and a happy ending.

## Structure

1. Start at the point of highest drama, using descriptive language that evokes strong emotion
2. Describe the turning point, when a key lesson was learned or a key event happened that started to change things for the better
3. Extract a lesson from the struggle and talk about how it changed your perspective
4. Optional call to action, inviting anyone going through something similar to get help from you

## Example

"The landlord handed me the eviction notice. My stomach sank. In that moment it hit me, I was a failed entrepreneur. I sat down, feeling rage, then sadness, then a sense of hopelessness. How could I have let things get to this point? They say it's in our lowest moments that we become truly open minded and ready to change. This was a turning point for me, the moment when I realized I couldn't treat my business like a hobby anymore. It was sink or swim, and I chose to swim."

## Persuasion at Work

- **Sensory Language**: Paint the scene with concrete details. The audience should feel the room, hear the sounds, see the moment.
- **Future Pacing**: Alternate tension and relief to keep them watching. The drama pulls them in; the resolution keeps them there.
