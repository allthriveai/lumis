Break someone's belief that they can only have one of two options. People limit themselves by thinking they have to sacrifice one thing for another. Show them they can have both.

## Structure

1. I used to believe that [insert a limiting belief about only being able to have one of two options, i.e. sacrificing one thing to get another]
2. Talk about the struggle and what it felt like to sacrifice
3. Talk about the moment you realized you didn't need to sacrifice, possibly due to a discovery or invention of a new method, process, or system
4. Talk about how this new way is superior to the old way of sacrifice
5. Call to action to learn more about the unique process

## Example

"I used to believe that I had to give up my favorite foods in order to lose weight and keep it off. Then I stumbled upon something called (insert your unique method or process) and realized that I could lose weight while still enjoying my comfort foods from time to time. In the past, dieting always felt like a sacrifice, and so I could never keep the weight off. Now it feels so much more sustainable, and I'm actually thoroughly enjoying it."

## Persuasion at Work

- **Have Your Cake**: Break false dichotomies. Show both/and instead of either/or. People light up when they realize they do not have to choose.
- **Opportunity Switch**: Replace the old vehicle entirely instead of improving it. The new approach makes the sacrifice unnecessary, not just tolerable.
