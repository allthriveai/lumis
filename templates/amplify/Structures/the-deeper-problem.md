Help someone realize the deeper root of their problem. We often think our problem is one thing, when it actually stems from something we're unaware of. Dissolve the root to stop problems from resurfacing.

## Structure

1. State the problem or symptom they might be dealing with
2. Tell a story about how you learned that this wasn't the "real" problem at all
3. Talk about the shift that happened in your life or someone else's that revealed the deeper root
4. Explain how addressing the deeper root leads to dramatically different results
5. Call to action (your choice)

## Example

"The real problem in your relationship is not your partner's behavior. I used to blame my partner for all the problems we were having, until I realized that the real problem is something much deeper. I started to see that how he acted towards me was also a reflection of how I perceived him, and vice versa. I started to take responsibility for the way I saw my partner instead of putting all the blame on him, and that's when everything started to change for the better."

## Note on Inner/Outer Alignment

Consider framing the deeper problem as an alignment issue between inner and outer worlds. Outer results often reflect inner beliefs. The "fruit" comes from the roots. When someone changes the surface behavior without changing the belief underneath, the old pattern returns. Address the root and the symptoms dissolve on their own.

## Persuasion at Work

- **Symptoms Before Solutions**: Name what they are experiencing before you diagnose the cause. People need to feel seen before they will listen.
- **Insight**: Reveal the hidden connection between the symptom and the root. The "aha" moment does the persuading for you.
- **Compounding Consequences**: Show how the root cause compounds over time, making small problems into big ones if left unaddressed.
