Take any useful concept and make it visual. Show, don't tell. This creates curiosity, keeps attention, and facilitates deeper learning. It positions you as more of an expert.

## Ways to use

- Use analogies and metaphors to paint a picture in someone's mind
- Use diagrams and flowcharts to show the connection of ideas
- Use visual frameworks to explain systems in a more understandable way
- Use pictures, mockups, and illustrations to show what you're talking about
- Add text captions or visual elements to video content to make it unique and compelling

## Tips

- Instead of saying "here are the 4 steps to ____", actually show the 4 steps in a visual framework. Reveal one step at a time to create curiosity
- Think about what your idea looks like in imagination. Could you use an analogy or metaphor to describe it? A journey toward a goal could be illustrated as climbing a mountain
- Even when not showing the concept visually, use descriptive words that paint a picture in someone's mind

## Persuasion at Work

- **Cognitive Ease**: Visuals reduce mental load. A diagram that takes 5 seconds to understand beats a paragraph that takes 30.
- **Put a Fence Around It**: A named visual framework becomes shareable intellectual property. People reference "the funnel" or "the flywheel" because the image sticks.
