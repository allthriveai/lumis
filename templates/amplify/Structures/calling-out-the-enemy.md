Call out an "enemy" or external force to relieve the guilt or shame someone might feel for having a particular problem. Move from blame to acceptance to empowerment.

## Structure

1. It's not your fault if you've been [struggling with a specific problem]
2. Call out the "enemy" who is creating the problem
3. Explain why the enemy's way is inferior
4. Introduce a new and better way to do things
5. Optional call to action to learn more

## Example

"Chances are, it's not your fault if you've been struggling to lose weight and keep it off. Why? Massive corporations are sneaking unhealthy ingredients into common foods that are ordinarily considered healthy. Just look at the amount of sugar in this oatmeal, or in this can of peas. These companies know if they can sneak sugar and other ingredients into these foods, that you'll be more likely to consume more of them. It's all about the money. So don't feel bad if your dieting efforts haven't yielded the results you'd hoped for."

## Persuasion at Work

- **Common Enemies**: Rally against a system or pattern, never a person. The audience bonds with you when you share their frustration at something bigger than both of you.
- **Loss Aversion**: Show what the enemy costs them. People act faster to stop losing than to start gaining.
