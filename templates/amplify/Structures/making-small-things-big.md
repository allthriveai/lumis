Shift behavior by illustrating how small things compound over time into big things (positive or negative). What seems insignificant stays out of awareness and goes unaddressed. Make the invisible visible.

## Structure

1. Illustrate the common experience of a particular habit that seems relatively insignificant in the short term
2. Paint the picture of how this small, harmless habit turns into something much bigger over time (positive or negative)
3. Use personal stories or examples from your own life or someone else's when possible
4. Optional call to action to take charge of these "small" things to create the big outcomes they want

## Example

"A little midnight snack, just a few hundred calories. Can't do much harm, right? A few slices of pizza a couple times a week. No big deal. There's no noticeable difference compared to last week when you look in the mirror. But year over year? Those little midnight snacks are adding up, aren't they? The small things seem relatively insignificant in the short term, so we rarely think twice. But when you look at your life in terms of years and decades rather than days and weeks, you start to see that those 'small' things are actually BIG things."

## Persuasion at Work

- **Compounding Consequences**: Show the exponential impact of repeated small actions. One day means nothing. One thousand days changes everything.
- **Insight**: Make the invisible visible. The power of this structure is showing people what they cannot see on their own.
