Make yourself relatable by sharing the story of your success as an "ordinary" person who didn't see themselves as a leader or someone capable of great things. This helps the viewer see themselves in you, increasing their belief that they can have a breakthrough too.

## Structure

1. Tell the story of your humble beginnings
2. Talk about how you used to not believe you could end up where you are now
3. Talk about the struggle and adversity you went through to become the person you are today
4. Stress the fact that you are not special
5. Encourage the viewer to believe in themselves
6. Call them to action

## Example

"I was just a shy 21 year old kid with no confidence in myself. I didn't plan to be here speaking on stages. This was the last thing in the world I would have chosen for a career. I'm just an ordinary guy, like most of you in this room, but that doesn't mean we can't do extraordinary things. We all have a message worth sharing. There's no one here who can't do that, so the success you see I've had is just as possible for every one of you. I truly believe that."

## Persuasion at Work

- **Situational Relatability**: The audience must see themselves in the hero. The more ordinary you make yourself, the more they believe the outcome is possible for them.
- **Progressive Agreement**: Build belief gradually. Start with "I was just like you," then move to "and here's what happened." Each step makes the next easier to accept.
