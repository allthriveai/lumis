Pave a clear path from where someone is to where they want to be. By creating a system, process, or framework, you position yourself as a guide. A multi-step approach creates curiosity and keeps attention through the entire message.

## Structure

1. Here is the process/system/framework/steps I used to [achieve specific outcome]
2. List the steps and provide insight. For maximum impact, some steps should be controversial or go against common advice
3. Optional call to action to learn more

## Example

"Here are the 4 things I did in the last year to go from making $30,000 per year to making $100,000 per year in my coaching business. Step 1. I narrowed my niche and got clear on who was the best fit for my coaching. Step 2. I focused 80% of my time and energy on improving my offer and my marketing message. Step 3. I raised my prices so I could serve my clients better and get them even better results. Step 4. I stopped doing all the things, and simplified my business to one social media platform and one core offer."

## Persuasion at Work

- **Future Pacing**: Describe the end state so they stay for the steps. If they can picture the destination, they will follow the map.
- **Cognitive Ease**: One step at a time, clear progression. Numbered steps signal "this is simple enough to follow."
