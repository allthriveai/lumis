Provide inspiration by challenging pessimism and painting the picture of the best case scenario. Encourage dreams and don't let self-doubt win.

## Structure

1. Imagine if [paint the picture of the best case scenario, tell in story format when possible]
2. Challenge their doubts and/or explain why their doubts are not helping them
3. Encourage their dreams and explain why it's possible for them
4. Call them to some sort of action

## Example

"Imagine if all your doubts were wrong and all your plans really worked out. Imagine if your business really gave you the freedom you thought it could. Imagine waking up knowing that you get to choose how you spend this day. You start the day with peace. You take it slow. No rush to get anywhere, no rush to start work, because the money flows in regardless. You just get to do what you love. The byproduct: Abundance. Well guess what? There's no reason this can't be your reality. So stop doubting. It's time to move forward with full confidence and faith."

## Persuasion at Work

- **Future Pacing**: Paint the future as if already achieved. "Imagine waking up..." puts them inside the outcome before they decide to pursue it.
- **Sensory Language**: Use specific images, feelings, and concrete details to make the scenario real. Vague dreams do not motivate. Vivid ones do.
