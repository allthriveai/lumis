Break a limiting belief through a personal story. Help your audience see the problem from a new perspective so they're empowered to make a change using a superior solution.

## Structure

1. I used to believe [insert a common limiting belief your target audience might hold]
2. Then I realized how wrong I was: [tell the story of struggle and how you came to realize there must be a better way]
3. Everyone tells you that [old way] is the best way to [achieve specific outcome]
4. But if that's true, then why does [insert example or reason why the old way is not effective in many cases]
5. After struggling, I realized [why the new way is better]
6. If you want to learn more about [the new method/strategy], then [insert call to action]

## Example

"I used to believe that losing weight was all about cutting my calories and exercising more. But after years of trying different diet and workout plans, but never hitting my true goals, I realized there had to be something I was missing. 'Why do some people seem to achieve their fitness goals so easily? Why do some people never struggle with their weight at all?' Then it hit me. It's about identity. Without an identity shift, any weight loss will be temporary at best."

## Persuasion at Work

- **Contrasting Paths**: Show the before/after clearly so the audience feels the distance between the old belief and the new one.
- **Breaking False Beliefs**: Identify the specific misconception holding them back, then replace it with something they can test for themselves.
