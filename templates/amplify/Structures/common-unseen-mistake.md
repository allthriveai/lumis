Point out a common mistake your audience is making that costs them time, money, or effort. Explain why they don't realize it, then offer a better way.

## Structure

1. Nearly everyone I see is [making this common mistake]
2. And it's preventing them from [getting desirable result]
3. I understand why: [why doing this seems like the right thing to do or focus on]
4. I used to believe this too. [insert personal story or anecdote]
5. But what I discovered is [why this holds them back and why there's a better way]
6. Optional call to action inviting them to learn the better way

## Example

"Almost every single musician I see is making this mistake, and it's the #1 thing preventing them from actually making a living from their music. I used to think that the key to success as a musician was to just make great music. I thought it would just spread on its own if people liked it. But here's the truth: it doesn't matter how great your music is if people don't know about it. Making good music is key, but what's more important for your financial success is knowing how to market that music to the masses."

## Persuasion at Work

- **Breaking False Beliefs**: The mistake is invisible because of a misconception. Name the misconception first, then the mistake becomes obvious.
- **Progressive Agreement**: Get them nodding about symptoms before revealing the mistake. Agreement lowers resistance to the uncomfortable truth.
