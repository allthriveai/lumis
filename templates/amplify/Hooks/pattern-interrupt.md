# Pattern Interrupt

Say something unexpected for the context. This works because the brain runs on prediction. When it scrolls through content, it's pattern-matching: "advice, advice, motivational quote, ad, advice." Something that breaks the pattern forces a reset. The brain stops predicting and starts paying attention.

## Good Examples

- Use with caution. [Achieving result] has never been this easy and might make your friends jealous.
- 3 strange things I do that help me [achieve result].
- And then just like that, I wasn't [negative state] anymore.
- Every day I feel a bit of regret for not learning about [niche] sooner.
- I deleted my entire content strategy last Tuesday. Best decision I made all year.
- Stop trying to [achieve result]. Seriously. Here's what to do instead.
- I'm about to talk you out of [thing they want to buy/do]. And you'll thank me for it.
- The worst advice I ever followed was "just be yourself." Here's what actually works.

## Bad Examples

- WAIT. Before you scroll, you NEED to see this. (All caps and urgency markers are the oldest trick on the internet. They don't interrupt the pattern, they ARE the pattern.)
- This is going to blow your mind. (Promising a mind-blowing experience is a pattern audiences have seen thousands of times. It blends in.)
- You're not going to believe this. (Same energy as clickbait thumbnails with shocked faces. The audience has been trained to ignore it.)

## Anti-Patterns

- Confusing randomness with surprise. Saying something nonsensical isn't a pattern interrupt. It has to be unexpected AND relevant to what follows.
- Over-using this hook type. If every post opens with something "weird," the weird becomes your pattern. Save it for when you have genuinely surprising content.
- Leading with negativity just for shock. "I hate my audience" might stop the scroll, but it also stops the trust.
- Forgetting to connect the interrupt to your point. The unexpected opening needs to lead somewhere. If the rest of the content doesn't pay off the surprise, the audience feels tricked.
