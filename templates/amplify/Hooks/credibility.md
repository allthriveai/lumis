# Credibility

Lead with proof, experience, or authority. This works because it answers "why should I listen to you?" before the audience has to ask. Once credibility is established, everything that follows carries more weight.

## Good Examples

- I spent [months/years] studying [niche] so you don't have to. Here's [timeframe] of learning in 60 seconds.
- The #1 thing I tell every [target audience] who's trying to [achieve result] is...
- I don't know any better way than this to [achieve result] if you're a [target audience].
- Here are the [number] possible ways I know of to [achieve result] as a [target audience].
- So I built this method for [achieving result] without [difficult process]. Here's an overview.
- After coaching 200+ [target audience], the same mistake comes up in 90% of first calls.
- I've reviewed 1,000 landing pages this year. The ones that convert all do this one thing.
- What separates a successful [target audience] from an unsuccessful one? Here are my observations after [number] years in this space.

## Bad Examples

- I'm an expert in [niche] and here's what I think. (Self-labeling as an expert is the weakest form of credibility. Show evidence, don't announce a title.)
- Trust me, I know what I'm talking about. (Asking for trust is the opposite of earning it. This makes people trust you less.)
- As someone with a lot of experience in this area... (Vague. "A lot of experience" could mean anything. Specific numbers and outcomes build real credibility.)

## Anti-Patterns

- Name-dropping credentials without connecting them to the audience's problem. Nobody cares about your resume unless it explains why you can help them.
- Inflating numbers or timelines. If you coached 30 people, say 30. Audiences detect exaggeration and it destroys the trust you're trying to build.
- Leading with credentials for too long. One sentence of proof, then move to value. If your whole hook is about you, you've lost the audience.
- Borrowing authority you haven't earned. "Studies show..." without citing which studies is weaker than sharing your own direct experience.
