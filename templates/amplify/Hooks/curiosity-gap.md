# Curiosity Gap

Open a gap between what someone knows and what they want to know. The brain treats an open loop like an unfinished task. It nags until it gets closed. That's why people keep watching.

## Good Examples

- I don't think enough people fully realize that [your unique insight].
- [Thing they think they have to do] just to [achieve result]? It doesn't have to be that way.
- 3 counter-intuitive truths about [niche] and what it takes to succeed.
- 3 strange things I do that help me [achieve result].
- If most of the information about how to [achieve result] is free on Google, why do so many people still not have what they want?
- There's one thing every successful [target audience] does that nobody talks about.
- I changed one line in my cold emails. Response rate tripled.
- The highest-paid people in my industry all share one habit. It has nothing to do with skill.

## Bad Examples

- I have a secret to share with you. (No specificity. "A secret" could be anything, so the brain doesn't lock onto it.)
- You won't believe what happened next. (Clickbait pattern. Audiences recognize it and scroll past.)
- Here's something interesting I learned. ("Interesting" is the reader's judgment to make. Telling them it's interesting closes the gap before it opens.)

## Anti-Patterns

- Opening a loop you never close. If the payoff doesn't match the setup, you lose trust permanently.
- Making the gap too wide. "This one thing changed everything about my life" feels like a lie. Keep the claim scoped to something believable.
- Stacking multiple gaps in one hook. One open loop pulls people in. Three open loops feel like a riddle.
- Using vague teasers instead of specific ones. "This changed my business" is weak. "This changed how I price my services" is strong. The more specific the gap, the harder it pulls.
