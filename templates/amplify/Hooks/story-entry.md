# Story Entry

Drop into the middle of a scene. Narrative pulls people forward because they need to know what happens next. Starting in the middle (in medias res) skips the boring setup and lands the audience in a moment with stakes already in play.

## Good Examples

- And then just like that, I wasn't [negative state] anymore.
- Tell me if you can relate. You set out to [achieve result], start feeling [positive feeling], then results don't match expectations, so you slow down or give up, only to repeat the cycle. I've been there.
- If I could rewind time, here's what I would do differently to [achieve result] in the shortest time possible.
- The craziest thing happened when I started my [niche] journey.
- When I started [niche], I thought it would be all sunshine and rainbows. Then reality hit.
- I was sitting in a parking lot, staring at a rejection email, when I decided to change everything about how I sell.
- Three months into my business, I had $12 in my checking account and a client who wouldn't pay. Here's what I did next.
- She looked at my portfolio and said, "This is fine, but I wouldn't pay for it." That sentence rebuilt my entire career.

## Bad Examples

- Let me tell you a story about my journey. (This is a label, not an entry point. You're announcing a story instead of telling one.)
- So my story starts back in 2019 when I first got interested in [niche]. (Chronological openings are the slowest way to start. Nobody cares about the timeline until they care about the stakes.)
- I want to share my experience with you. (Passive. Put us in the scene instead of asking permission to start.)

## Anti-Patterns

- Starting with backstory instead of a scene. "I grew up in a small town and always wanted to..." is setup. Drop us into the moment that matters.
- Telling emotions instead of showing them. "I was really frustrated" is weak. "I closed my laptop and didn't open it for two weeks" is a scene.
- Overpromising the story. "What happened next changed my life forever" sets an expectation most stories can't meet. Let the story speak.
- Describing what you're about to say instead of saying it. "I'm going to tell you about the time I..." Just tell us.
