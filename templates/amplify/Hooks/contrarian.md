# Contrarian

Challenge a belief the audience holds as true. This creates cognitive dissonance: their brain flags a conflict between what they believe and what you just said, and they have to keep watching to resolve the tension.

## Good Examples

- The days of [old method] are over. Here's how to [achieve result] without all the struggle.
- Why I don't [common method] as a [target audience] and why you shouldn't either.
- Anyone telling you that you have to [difficult method] just to [achieve result] is wrong. Here's why.
- Not enough people are talking about the fact that you don't have to [common method] to [achieve result].
- The gurus want you to believe that [achieving result] is as simple as following their step-by-step system. Here's what they leave out.
- I stopped meal prepping. My nutrition got better.
- Everyone says you need 10,000 hours. I got hired after 6 months. Here's what actually mattered.
- Your morning routine is not why you're stuck.

## Bad Examples

- I don't agree with the mainstream approach. (Too vague. What approach? Why? No tension without specifics.)
- Hot take: [niche] is broken. (Empty provocation. If you don't say what's broken, there's nothing to resolve.)
- Unpopular opinion but I think [common belief] is overrated. (Labeling it "unpopular opinion" kills the punch. It signals you're hedging.)

## Anti-Patterns

- Contrarian for shock value without substance. If you can't back the claim in the next 30 seconds, don't open with it.
- Softening the challenge with "I might be wrong but..." or "just my opinion." Commit to the position or pick a different hook type.
- Attacking people instead of beliefs. "You're doing it wrong" creates defensiveness. "This method doesn't work because..." creates curiosity.
- Restating conventional wisdom as contrarian. "You should work smarter, not harder" is not a challenge. It's a greeting card.
