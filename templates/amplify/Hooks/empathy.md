# Empathy

Name the audience's pain before offering anything. Feeling understood is more powerful than being taught. When someone describes your exact situation, your brain decides: this person gets it. That earns attention in a way that tips and tactics never can.

## Good Examples

- If you're a [target audience] who wants to [achieve result] without [thing they dread], this is for you.
- Trying to [achieve result] but feeling [negative feeling]? Here's a method to help you move forward.
- Feeling [negative feeling] is common when you're trying to [achieve result]. Here's how to start feeling [positive feeling] instead.
- When setting out to [achieve result], it's normal to feel [negative feeling]. But if you avoid this one mistake, the path gets easier.
- If you're struggling with [achieving result], steal this strategy from me.
- You've watched the tutorials. You've bought the course. You've done the work. And the results still aren't there. I know that feeling.
- You're not lazy. You're not behind. You're just using a method that wasn't built for how you actually work.
- That sinking feeling when you check your analytics and nothing has changed? I sat with that for two years before I figured out what was wrong.

## Bad Examples

- I know exactly how you feel. (You don't. And claiming to makes the audience defensive. Describe the feeling instead of claiming to share it.)
- Are you struggling? I can help! (Too generic. "Struggling" covers everything from a bad hair day to bankruptcy. Name the specific pain.)
- Everyone goes through hard times. (Platitude. This minimizes their experience instead of validating it.)

## Anti-Patterns

- Naming pain you haven't experienced or researched. Audiences can tell when you're guessing at their problems vs. when you've lived them.
- Moving to the solution too fast. Sit in the pain for at least one full sentence. If you rush to the fix, the empathy feels like a sales tactic.
- Using empathy as manipulation. "I know you're scared, and that's why you need my course" weaponizes the connection. Name the pain, then offer genuine value.
- Being vague about the feeling. "Feeling stuck" is overused. "Staring at a blank screen for 45 minutes and then checking your phone" is specific enough to trigger recognition.
