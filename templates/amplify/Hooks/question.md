# Question

Ask something the audience can't ignore. Questions activate the brain differently than statements. They demand an internal response. Even when someone doesn't want to engage, a well-placed question forces their brain to start formulating an answer. That's attention you didn't have to ask for.

## Good Examples

- [Common question]? My answer might surprise you.
- Have you ever asked, [common question]? It's a common question I get. Here's an uncommon answer.
- What do you do when you're trying to [achieve result] but you're tired of [difficult method]?
- Tell me I'm not the only [target audience] who thinks [inferior method] is not the way to [achieve result].
- Am I the only one who's tired of being told that to [achieve result], I have to [difficult method]?
- What would you do with an extra 10 hours a week?
- If you could only give one piece of advice to a new [target audience], what would it be? Here's mine.
- Why do the people who work the hardest in [niche] often make the least money?

## Bad Examples

- Want to hear something cool? (Not a real question. It's a request for permission dressed as curiosity. The audience doesn't care if it's "cool" until you prove it.)
- Have you ever thought about [very obvious thing]? (If the answer is obviously "yes," the question doesn't create any tension. Ask something that forces a pause.)
- What if I told you there's a better way? (Cliche. This has been used in so many ads that it triggers skepticism, not curiosity.)

## Anti-Patterns

- Asking questions you immediately answer. "What's the best way to grow on social? It's consistency." kills the gap. Let the question sit for a beat.
- Asking questions that are too broad. "What does success mean to you?" is a therapy prompt, not a hook. Scope it to something specific.
- Using rhetorical questions as filler. "Ever wonder why some people succeed and others don't?" is so generic it slides off the brain. Make the question sharp enough to sting.
- Starting every post with a question. It becomes predictable. If your audience can guess your hook structure, it stops working.
