# Shock/Data

Lead with a surprising fact, stat, or result. This works because it violates expectations. When something doesn't match what the brain predicted, it flags the moment as important and demands an explanation. The audience stays to find out why.

## Good Examples

- Why is no one in the [niche] world talking about this right now?
- [Method]: The exact system I used to [achieve result] without [difficult process].
- How [method] took me from [undesired state] to [desired state] in [timeframe].
- 92% of people who start [niche] quit within the first year. The 8% who stay all do this one thing differently.
- I made $0 my first 11 months. Month 12, I made $14,000. The only thing I changed was how I opened my calls.
- The average [target audience] spends 6 hours a week on [task] that produces zero results. Here's what to do instead.
- I tested 47 subject lines last quarter. The winner had 3 words.
- Companies spend $4,700 per hire on average. Most of that money is wasted before the first interview.

## Bad Examples

- Here's a mind-blowing statistic. (Telling someone a stat is mind-blowing robs them of the experience. Just share the stat.)
- Did you know that [commonly known fact]? (If everyone already knows it, there's no surprise. The stat needs to violate expectations, not confirm them.)
- Studies show that [vague claim] is true. ("Studies show" without specifics reads as made up. Name the number, the source, or the result.)

## Anti-Patterns

- Using fake or inflated numbers. One fact-check from your audience and your credibility is gone. Round numbers are fine. Made-up numbers are not.
- Burying the surprise. The shocking part needs to come first. "After a lot of research, I found that 92% of people quit" is slower than "92% of people quit."
- Sharing data without context. "I got 10,000 views" means nothing without knowing the baseline, the timeframe, or why it matters.
- Stacking too many stats. One sharp number is more memorable than five. Pick the most surprising one and let it breathe.
