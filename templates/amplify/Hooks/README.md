# Hook Types

8 hook types based on why they work, not fill-in-the-blank templates.

Each type has a principle, good examples, bad examples, and anti-patterns. Pick the type that fits your story, then write a hook that follows the principle.

## Types

1. **Contrarian** — challenge a belief
2. **Curiosity Gap** — open an unanswered question
3. **Story Entry** — drop into a scene
4. **Credibility** — lead with proof
5. **Empathy** — name the pain
6. **Shock/Data** — lead with a surprising fact
7. **Question** — ask something they can't ignore
8. **Pattern Interrupt** — say something unexpected
