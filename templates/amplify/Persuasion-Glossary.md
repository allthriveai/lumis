# Persuasion Glossary

10 principles that show up across hooks and structures. Not techniques to deploy. Lenses to understand why content works.

## 1. Curiosity Gap
Open a loop between what someone knows and what they want to know. The brain can't leave it unresolved. Use in hooks and transitions.

## 2. Loss Aversion
People feel losses twice as strongly as gains. Showing what they'll lose by not acting is more powerful than showing what they'll gain by acting.

## 3. Social Proof
People follow what others do, especially others like them. Case studies, community, and shared experiences create it naturally.

## 4. Cognitive Ease
Simple ideas spread. Complex ideas die. Short sentences, familiar words, one idea per section. If it needs re-reading, rewrite it.

## 5. Anchoring
The first number or frame shapes everything that follows. Set the reference point before introducing your idea.

## 6. Reciprocity
Give value before asking for anything. Free insight, honest admission, useful framework. The audience feels the debt without being told to.

## 7. Scarcity and Urgency
Limited time or access increases perceived value. Only works when real. Fake urgency destroys trust faster than no urgency at all.

## 8. Progressive Agreement
Stack small yeses before a big ask. Start with statements they already agree with. Each agreement lowers resistance to the next.

## 9. Identity
People act consistent with who they believe they are. Frame your message around identity ("you're the kind of person who...") instead of behavior ("you should do X").

## 10. Sensory Specificity
Concrete details beat abstract claims. "The demo was in 20 minutes and the API was returning 500s" hits harder than "things went wrong before the meeting." Engage sight, sound, and feeling.
