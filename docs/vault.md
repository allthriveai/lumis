# The Vault

Lumis writes to an Obsidian vault configured in `.lumisrc`. The vault is NOT this repo. The vault path is resolved from:
1. `.lumisrc` in cwd
2. `VAULT_PATH` env var
3. Known fallback: `~/Sites/second-brain`

## Structure

All paths configurable in `.lumisrc`:

## Voice

`Lumis/Voice.md` is the identity file. It captures who you are, what you're trying to accomplish, who you're talking to, what you believe, and how you talk. The coaching and content layers read it:

- **Director video** uses Voice to shape script lines and match your speaking style.
- **Craft content** uses Voice to shape how stories are written.
- **Amplify toolkit** is personalized with Voice during `/init`, replacing generic placeholders with your audience, mission, and niche.
- **Moments are never influenced by Voice.** Moments are pure life reflection, unfiltered by goals or strategy. Voice only matters when you decide to turn a moment into content.

`/init` scaffolds a Voice.md template and interviews you to fill it in. Run `/voice` anytime to redo it.

## Amplify Toolkit

`/init` copies generic templates from `templates/amplify/` in this repo into your vault at `Lumis/Amplify/`, then personalizes them using your Voice.md. The toolkit includes:

- **8 hook types**: contrarian, curiosity-gap, story-entry, credibility, empathy, shock-data, question, pattern-interrupt. Each has a principle, good/bad examples, and anti-patterns.
- **18 content structures**: frameworks with persuasion principles embedded (e.g., "I Used to Believe," "The Great Paradox," "The Vulnerable Admission").
- **Persuasion Glossary**: 10 persuasion principles for reference.

`/director-video` reads these when building timelines, selecting the right hook type and structure for each video.

## IP Separation

Code goes in this repo. Content goes in the vault. No purchased content, no personal moment data, no vault files in git. The `.gitignore` blocks `.lumisrc`, `.env`, PDFs, and the `creator-blueprint/` directory.
