# Social Coach

## Instructions

When the user runs `/social-coach`, optionally followed by a reference to a specific moment, story, or learning:

### Step 0: Load Configuration

Find the `.lumisrc` config file to resolve the vault path and all content directories. Check these locations in order:

1. `.lumisrc` in the current working directory
2. `.lumisrc` at the path specified by `VAULT_PATH` environment variable
3. `/Users/allierays/Sites/second-brain/.lumisrc` as a known fallback

Read the config and extract:

```
vaultPath            → absolute path to the Obsidian vault
paths.moments        → moments folder relative to vault root (default: "Lumis/Moments")
paths.stories        → stories folder relative to vault root (default: "Lumis/Stories")
paths.learnings      → learnings folder relative to vault root (default: "Lumis/Learnings")
paths.scripts        → scripts folder relative to vault root (default: "Lumis/Scripts")
paths.strategyDocs   → strategy docs folder relative to vault root (default: "2 - Areas/All Thrive")
paths.amplify        → amplify folder relative to vault root (default: "Lumis/Amplify")
```

All paths resolve relative to `vaultPath`.

### Step 1: Read Strategy Context

Read the following files from `{vaultPath}/{paths.strategyDocs}/`:

- **`Content Pillars.md`** — the 4 content pillars and their target distribution:
  - Building (30%) — building with AI, tools, shipping products
  - Strategy (30%) — AI strategy, how to think about adoption
  - Ethics (20%) — AI ethics, responsible use, character
  - Thriving (20%) — thriving with AI, force multiplier lifestyle
- **`Content Strategy.md`** — the one-idea system, platform formats, no-pitch rule
- **`Social Media Plan.md`** — phased approach, video structure (hook -> problem -> insight -> takeaway -> CTA), cross-posting workflow

These documents define the voice, rules, and structure for all content. Every recommendation must align with them.

### Step 2: Read Content Inventory

Scan the vault for postable content:

**Moments** — read all files in `{vaultPath}/{paths.moments}/`. Focus on moments where:
- `story-potential` is `high`
- `story-status` is `captured` or `developing`
- Extract: title, date, themes, moment-type, 5-second moment, story potential

**Learnings** — read all files in `{vaultPath}/{paths.learnings}/` (excluding README.md). Extract:
- Title, pillar, topic tags, the core insight (first paragraph after heading)

**Existing scripts** — read all files in `{vaultPath}/{paths.scripts}/` to:
- Avoid recommending content that's already been scripted
- Track pillar balance across existing scripts (count scripts per pillar)

**Amplify toolkit** — read from `{vaultPath}/{paths.amplify}/`:
- `Structures/` — content frameworks and formats
- `Triggers/` — persuasion patterns and psychological hooks
- `Hooks.md` — scroll-stopping opening lines
- `Prompts.md` — content idea generators

If the user pointed at a specific piece of content (e.g., `/social-coach [[Lumis/Moments/2025-01-15 - The question I couldn't answer]]`), load that piece and focus the recommendation on it.

### Step 3: Recommend

Based on the strategy context and content inventory, recommend which moments, stories, or learnings to post. For each recommendation, specify:

- **What to post** — the source content (moment, learning, or story)
- **Which platform** — LinkedIn, X, YouTube, or multiple
- **Which pillar** — building, strategy, ethics, or thriving
- **Which hook style** — from the Hooks.md collection or a custom one
- **Which structure** — from the Structures/ collection
- **Why this one** — what makes it timely, relevant, or high-potential right now

**Pillar balance check:** Compare the distribution of existing scripts against the target (building 30%, strategy 30%, ethics 20%, thriving 20%). If any pillar is underrepresented, flag it and bias recommendations toward filling the gap.

If the user pointed at specific content, skip the broad recommendation and focus entirely on that piece: which platform, which pillar, which hook, which structure, and why.

### Step 4: Generate Platform Drafts

For each recommended piece (or the user's specified content), generate platform-specific drafts:

**LinkedIn:**
- 3-5 sentences. One idea per post.
- Professional but opinionated. Write like a person with a take, not a brand.
- Strong opening line that stops the scroll. No "I'm excited to share" or "Here's what I learned."
- End with a question or a clear takeaway, not a call to like/share.
- 3-5 hashtags maximum, placed at the end. No hashtag spam.

**X (Twitter):**
- Sharp one-liner version of the same idea. Punchy, direct, quotable.
- If the content is technical or complex, outline a thread: tweet 1 (hook), tweets 2-4 (the insight broken into pieces), tweet 5 (takeaway or question).
- Captions on any video content.

**YouTube (Shorts):**
- Script with timed sections:
  - **Hook** (5-10s) — grab attention, state the tension or question
  - **Problem** (15-20s) — what's going wrong, what people get wrong, or what they don't know
  - **Insight** (20-30s) — the answer, the reframe, the thing you learned
  - **Takeaway** (10-15s) — what to do with this information
  - **CTA** (5s) — follow for more, comment what you think, etc.
- Total script should target under 60 seconds when spoken.
- Searchable title that someone would actually type into YouTube.
- Hook must land in the first 3 seconds.

### Step 5: Save Scripts

For each generated draft, write a script file to `{vaultPath}/{paths.scripts}/` with the following format:

Filename: `YYYY-MM-DD-platform-short-title.md` (e.g., `2025-01-20-linkedin-testing-ai-for-character.md`)

```markdown
---
title: "Script title"
type: script
platform: [linkedin, x, youtube]
pillar: "building"
source: "[[Lumis/Moments/2025-01-15 - The question I couldn't answer]]"
structure: "Hook -> Problem -> Insight -> Takeaway"
status: draft
created: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [script, pillar/building]
---

# [Title]

[The platform-specific script content]
```

Rules for saving:
- `platform` is an array — a script may target multiple platforms
- `source` uses a wiki-link to the original moment, learning, or story
- `pillar` matches one of: building, strategy, ethics, thriving
- `structure` names the framework used from the Amplify toolkit
- `status` starts as `draft`
- `created` is today's date
- `tags` always include `script` and `pillar/[pillar-name]`

If generating drafts for multiple platforms from the same source, create one script file per platform so each can be tracked and updated independently.

### Step 6: Report

Give a concise summary of what was generated:

```
**Scripts created**: [count]
**Platforms**: [list of platforms covered]
**Pillars**: [which pillars these scripts serve]
**Pillar balance**: [current distribution vs. target, flag any gaps]

**Why these recommendations:**
- [1-2 sentences per script on why this content, this platform, this structure]

**Saved to**: [list of script file paths]
```

If pillar imbalances exist, note them:
> "You're heavy on [pillar] and light on [pillar]. Next time, look for content that fits [underrepresented pillar]."

Apply humanizer rules to all prose in the report and in the generated scripts:
- No AI vocabulary (delve, landscape, crucial, leverage, robust, innovative)
- No filler phrases or significance inflation
- No em dash overuse — use commas, colons, or periods
- Vary sentence length. Be specific. Have opinions.
- Preserve the user's voice in any quoted material

## Baked-In Platform Knowledge

Reference these guidelines when making recommendations:

**LinkedIn:**
- Native video outperforms link posts by a wide margin. Upload video directly, never link to YouTube.
- Best posting times: Tuesday through Thursday, 8-10am in the audience's timezone.
- The 9/10 rule: 9 out of 10 posts should be pure value with no mention of product or service. 1 in 10 can include a soft mention.
- Document posts (carousels) perform well for frameworks and step-by-step content.
- First line is everything. If it doesn't stop the scroll, nothing else matters.

**X (Twitter):**
- Punchy and direct. Cut every word that doesn't earn its place.
- Threads work well for technical breakdowns. Tweet 1 is the hook, everything flows from there.
- Always add captions to video. Most people scroll with sound off.
- Adapt from LinkedIn, don't copy-paste. The voice is different: more casual, sharper, fewer words.
- Quote tweets with a take outperform plain retweets.

**YouTube (Shorts):**
- Under 60 seconds. Tighter is better.
- Searchable titles that match what people actually type (not clever wordplay).
- Hook must land in the first 3 seconds or viewers swipe away.
- Face-to-camera with captions performs best.
- Post consistently. Algorithm rewards frequency.
