# Director Carousel

## Instructions

When the user runs `/director-carousel`, optionally followed by a story slug:

### Step 0: Load Context

Find the `.lumisrc` config file. Check these locations in order:

1. `.lumisrc` in the current working directory
2. `.lumisrc` at the path specified by `VAULT_PATH` environment variable

Read the config and resolve the vault path.

Read `{vaultPath}/{paths.voice}` (Voice.md) if it exists. This shapes tone and phrasing for the card copy.

Read `{vaultPath}/{paths.brand}/Brand.md` if it exists. Use the brand colors, visual style, and inspiration references when choosing image direction and card styling.

### Step 1: Find the Story

If the user provided a slug (e.g., `/director-carousel ethos-academy-why`), read directly from `{stories}/{slug}/story.md` and `{stories}/{slug}/raw.md`.

If no slug, scan `{vaultPath}/{paths.stories}/` for story folders. List stories that have a `story.md` with `craft-status: drafting` or `craft-status: workshopped` or `craft-status: told`. Present the list and let the user pick.

Read the chosen `story.md` and `raw.md`. Extract:
- `transformation` (before/after/change)
- `fiveSecondMoment`
- `openingScene`
- `theStakes`
- `theTurns`
- `theQuestion`
- `theStory`

Validate the story has at minimum: transformation, 5-second moment, and turns. If missing, tell the user: "This story needs more development. Run `/craft-content` first to fill in the missing pieces."

### Step 2: Read Amplify Toolkit

Load the Amplify context from the vault:
- Read all hook files from `{vaultPath}/{paths.amplifyHooks}/`
- Read all structure files from `{vaultPath}/{paths.amplifyStructures}/`
- Read the persuasion glossary from `{vaultPath}/{paths.amplifyPersuasion}/Persuasion-Glossary.md`

Use `buildAmplifyContext(config)` if available, or read the files directly.

### Step 3: Creative Brief

A multi-turn conversation that builds the creative direction before you touch the cards. Ask one or two questions at a time. Never dump all sub-steps in a single message.

#### Step 3a: Hook Exploration

Present all 8 hooks as a numbered menu. For each hook, write 1-2 example opening lines tailored to THIS story (use its transformation, 5-second moment, protagonist). Include one sentence per hook explaining WHY it works, naming the persuasion principle at play.

Example format:

```
1. **Curiosity Gap** — "Most AI agents have guardrails. Zero have character."
   Opens a gap the viewer needs closed. (Information-gap theory: withholding the answer creates pull.)

2. **Bold Claim** — "Your agent's safety benchmarks are measuring the wrong thing."
   Stakes a position that demands proof. (Commitment bias: a strong claim earns the chance to back it up.)

3. ...
```

End with: "Which pulls you in? You can pick one, combine ideas from two, or give me a direction and I'll draft something new."

#### Step 3b: Media & Visual Assets

Ask: "Do you have screenshots, diagrams, or visual assets for specific cards? Carousels work best with 2-3 visual anchors beyond text."

If yes, ask which cards they belong to.

If no, ask preferred visual style: photography, illustration, or text-only.

#### Step 3c: Call to Action

Ask: "What do you want people to do after seeing this?"

Present 4-5 concrete examples:
- Comment with their take
- Save the post for later
- DM you about the topic
- Follow for more on this subject
- Skip the ask entirely (let the content speak)

Reference the story's natural question from `theQuestion` and ask if they want to use it or something more specific.

#### Step 3d: Structure Recommendation

NOW recommend 2-3 structures. This comes after hook, media, and CTA are decided so reasoning can reference all three. For each structure:

- How it organizes the story beats (reference specific story elements)
- Why it fits the chosen hook (the transition from hook to body)
- Which persuasion principles it activates (by name, one sentence why)
- What it does well and what it sacrifices

Label one as **Recommended**, one as **Alternative**, optionally a third as **Dark horse**. Ask which feels right.

#### Step 3e: Platform Guidance

Give LinkedIn-specific carousel guidance:

- Sweet spot is 7-10 cards
- Card 1 stops the scroll. Bold, zero subtext.
- Card 2 must create momentum. If they don't swipe past card 2, you've lost them.
- Stat cards work best in positions 3-5 (after setup, before climax)
- CTA card should ask a commentable question, not "follow me for more"
- Closer card is name/handle only. No hard sell.

If the user mentions a different platform, adapt guidance accordingly.

#### Creative Brief Tone

- Have opinions. Say which hook you'd pick and why. Let the user override.
- Build on answers. Reference what they said in 3a when asking 3b.
- Ask one or two questions at a time. Never all 5 sub-steps at once.
- Use their words from raw.md and story.md.
- Be direct about trade-offs.
- Skip steps when the user already answered.
- If the user seems eager to see a draft, compress 3b-3e into one turn: "Before I build this: any visual assets to include, what's the CTA, and anything specific about card count?"

### Step 4: Build the Carousel

Map story elements to cards:
- `openingScene` or hook line from selected hook type -> card 1 (hook). Bold headline, zero subtext.
- `transformation.before` -> card 2 (narrative, setup). The "before" state.
- Key data, turns, or tension points -> cards 3-5 (stat, narrative, contrast). Each card is one idea.
- `fiveSecondMoment` -> card near the middle (narrative). The moment that changed everything.
- `transformation.after` -> contrast or takeaway card. The shift.
- `theQuestion` -> CTA card. A genuine question, not "follow me for more."
- Branded closer -> last card. Name/handle + one-line description. No hard sell.

#### Card Types

- **hook** — Bold headline, minimal subtext. Stops the scroll.
- **narrative** — Headline + subtext telling a story beat. 2-3 sentences max.
- **stat** — Big number/data point + supporting context.
- **quote** — Direct quote with attribution.
- **contrast** — Two columns (left vs right, before vs after).
- **takeaway** — Key insight distilled to one line.
- **cta** — Question or action prompt. Always the second-to-last card.
- **closer** — Branded sign-off. Always the last card.

#### Card Rules

- 5-10 cards total. 7-8 is the sweet spot.
- One idea per card. If you need a comma, you need two cards.
- Headline: max 10 words. Subtext: max 30 words.
- Hook card has zero subtext. The headline IS the hook.
- CTA card asks a genuine question, not "follow me for more."
- Closer card: name/handle + one-line description. No hard sell.
- Image direction tells a designer what to create. Be specific about layout, not about exact assets.
- Carousel reads as a story top to bottom. Each card should make the reader swipe.
- Apply humanizer rules to all copy.

### Step 5: Present and Edit

Show numbered card list:

```
## Carousel: "Story Title" (8 cards, LinkedIn)

1. [HOOK] "Most AI agents have guardrails. Zero have character."
2. [SETUP / narrative] "Six months ago I built an agent" — It passed every safety test...
3. [TENSION / stat] "67%" — of companies have no character evaluation...
4. [5-SEC MOMENT / narrative] "Then a user asked it something it shouldn't answer"
5. [TRANSFORMATION / contrast] Guardrails: "Don't do this" vs Character: "This is who I am"
6. [TAKEAWAY] "Character > Compliance"
7. [CTA] "What character traits would you want in your agent?"
8. [CLOSER] @handle — one-line description
```

Ask: "Does this flow? You can reorder, rewrite, add, remove, or change card types."

Loop until the user approves. They can:
- Reorder cards
- Rewrite headlines or subtext
- Change card types
- Add or remove cards
- Adjust image direction

### Step 6: Save Carousel

Write `{stories}/{slug}/carousel-{hook}-{slug}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md` (e.g., `carousel-curiosity-gap-ethos-academy-why-2026-03-01.md`) with this format:

```yaml

## Director's Notes

Hook: curiosity-gap — contrast between guardrails (expected) and character (unexpected).
Structure: problem-solution — setup the gap, show the moment, deliver the reframe.
```

After saving, emit a `carousel_created` signal to `{vaultPath}/{paths.signals}/signals.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "sig-[timestamp]-[random6hex]",
  "type": "carousel_created",
  "timestamp": "[ISO timestamp]",
  "data": {
    "slug": "[story-slug]",
    "storySource": "[[Lumis/Stories/slug/story.md]]",
    "hook": "[hook-type]",
    "structure": "[structure-name]",
    "platform": "linkedin",
    "cardCount": 8
  }
}
```

Log to session memory at `{vaultPath}/{paths.memory}/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md`:

```
- **HH:MM** — carousel_created: Built [N]-card carousel for "[title]" (LinkedIn)
```

### Step 7: Hand Off

Report what was saved:

```
Carousel saved: {stories}/{slug}/carousel-{hook}-{slug}-{date}.md
  Cards: {N} ({hookCount} hook, {narrativeCount} narrative, {statCount} stat, {contrastCount} contrast, {ctaCount} CTA, {closerCount} closer)
  Platform: LinkedIn

Next step: Take this to Canva or Figma. The card types, copy, and image direction are all in the file.
```

### Humanizer

Run a humanizer pass on all card headlines and subtext. No AI vocabulary (delve, landscape, crucial, leverage, robust, innovative). No filler phrases. Vary sentence length. Be specific. Preserve the user's voice from Voice.md.

Card copy should sound punchy and conversational. If a headline sounds like a corporate slide deck, rewrite it.

## Story Folder Structure

```
{stories}/{slug}/
  raw.md                                    <- free write + interview (craft-content)
  story.md                                  <- pure narrative (craft-content)
  video-{hook}-{slug}-{date}.md             <- video timeline (director-video)
  carousel-{hook}-{slug}-{date}.md          <- carousel cards (director-carousel)
  article-{hook}-{slug}-{date}.md           <- blog post (director-article)
```
