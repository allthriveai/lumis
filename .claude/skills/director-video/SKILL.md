# Director Video

## Instructions

When the user runs `/director-video`, optionally followed by a story slug:

### Step 0: Load Context

Find the `.lumisrc` config file. Check these locations in order:

1. `.lumisrc` in the current working directory
2. `.lumisrc` at the path specified by `VAULT_PATH` environment variable

Read the config and resolve the vault path.

Read `{vaultPath}/{paths.voice}` (Voice.md) if it exists. This shapes tone and phrasing for the script lines.

### Step 1: Find the Story

If the user provided a slug (e.g., `/director-video ethos-academy-why`), read directly from `{stories}/{slug}/story.md` and `{stories}/{slug}/raw.md`.

If no slug, scan `{vaultPath}/{paths.stories}/` for story folders. List stories that have a `story.md` with `craft-status: drafting` or `craft-status: workshopped` or `craft-status: told`. Present the list and let the user pick.

Read the chosen `story.md` and `raw.md`. Extract:
- `transformation` (before/after/change)
- `fiveSecondMoment`
- `openingScene`
- `theStakes`
- `theTurns`
- `theQuestion`
- `theStory`

Validate the story has at minimum: transformation, 5-second moment, and turns. If missing, tell the user: "This story needs more development. Run `/craft-content` first to fill in the missing pieces."

### Step 2: Read Amplify Toolkit

Load the Amplify context from the vault:
- Read all hook files from `{vaultPath}/{paths.amplifyHooks}/`
- Read all structure files from `{vaultPath}/{paths.amplifyStructures}/`
- Read the persuasion glossary from `{vaultPath}/{paths.amplifyPersuasion}/Persuasion-Glossary.md`

Use `buildAmplifyContext(config)` if available, or read the files directly.

### Step 3: Recommend Hook + Structure

Based on the story elements, recommend:

- **Hook type**: which of the 8 fits this story's opening. Consider the 5-second moment and transformation to pick the right hook.
- **Structure**: which of the 18 frameworks organizes the body. Match the story's arc (number of turns, type of transformation) to the framework.
- **Persuasion principles**: 2-3 that fit naturally into this story.

Present the recommendation with one sentence explaining each choice. Ask the user to confirm or pick different ones.

### Step 4: Build the Timeline

Generate the shot sequence following these rules:

**Shot types:**
- `avatar` — face-to-camera with script. Max 10s per shot. Split longer dialogue.
- `text-card` — visual text overlay. Types: stat, quote, contrast, list, statement.
- `branded-intro` — always shot 2, 3s.
- `branded-outro` — always last shot, 5s.
- `b-roll-placeholder` — dark card with direction text for CapCut replacement.

**Beat sequence:**
1. **Hook** (2-3s avatar): opening line from selected hook type. Grabs attention immediately.
2. **Branded intro** (3s): always shot 2.
3. **Setup** (5-10s avatar): before state from `transformation.before` and `openingScene`.
4. **Tension** (multiple shots): each turn gets an avatar shot (3-10s). Insert text cards at key data points or contrasts.
5. **5-second moment** (5-8s avatar): climax from `fiveSecondMoment`. This is the peak.
6. **Transformation** (5-8s avatar): after state from `transformation.after`.
7. **Takeaway** (3-5s): text card or avatar summarizing what changed.
8. **CTA** (3-5s avatar): genuine question from `theQuestion`.
9. **Branded outro** (5s): always last.

**B-roll placeholders**: insert where the story references something visual (a screen, a product, a place). These become CapCut edit points.

**Duration targets:**
- YouTube Shorts: 15-45s
- YouTube Long: 3-10min

Default to Shorts unless the story has enough depth for long-form. Ask the user which platform they're targeting.

### Step 5: Present and Edit

Show the numbered shot list in this format:

```
## Timeline: "Story Title" (~60s)

1. [HOOK / avatar / 3s] "What's the one question..."
2. [INTRO / branded / 3s]
3. [SETUP / avatar / 8s] "Six months ago..."
4. [TENSION / text-card:stat / 4s] "67% of companies..."
5. [5-SEC MOMENT / avatar / 6s] "Then a user asked..."
6. [TAKEAWAY / text-card:contrast / 5s] "Guardrails vs Character"
7. [CTA / avatar / 5s] "What character traits..."
8. [OUTRO / branded / 5s]

Avatar: 5 shots | Text cards: 2 | B-roll: 0 | Total: ~39s
```

Ask: "Does this flow? You can reorder, split, add, remove, or rewrite any shot."

Loop until the user approves. They can:
- Reorder shots
- Split a long shot into two
- Add or remove shots
- Rewrite any script line
- Change shot types (avatar to text-card, etc.)
- Adjust durations

### Step 6: Save Timeline

Write `{stories}/{slug}/timeline.md` with this format:

```yaml
---
title: "Story Title"
type: timeline
status: draft
source: "[[Lumis/Stories/slug/story.md]]"
hook: curiosity-gap
structure: point-of-high-drama
persuasion: [contrast-principle, sensory-specificity]
platform: youtube
targetDuration: 45
shots:
  - id: 1
    beat: hook
    shotType: avatar
    duration: 3
    script: "What's the one question no one asks about AI agents?"
    direction: "Tight framing, direct eye contact"
  - id: 2
    beat: intro
    shotType: branded-intro
    duration: 3
  # ... remaining shots
---

## Director's Notes

Hook: curiosity-gap — the question IS the hook.
Structure: point-of-high-drama — open near climax, pull back, deliver transformation.
```

After saving, emit a `timeline_created` signal to `{vaultPath}/{paths.signals}/signals.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "sig-[timestamp]-[random6hex]",
  "type": "timeline_created",
  "timestamp": "[ISO timestamp]",
  "data": {
    "slug": "[story-slug]",
    "storySource": "[[Lumis/Stories/slug/story.md]]",
    "hook": "[hook-type]",
    "structure": "[structure-name]",
    "platform": "[platform]",
    "shotCount": 8,
    "targetDuration": 45
  }
}
```

Log to session memory at `{vaultPath}/{paths.memory}/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md`:

```
- **HH:MM** — timeline_created: Built [N]-shot timeline for "[title]" (~[duration]s, [platform])
```

### Step 7: Optionally Produce

Ask: "Timeline saved. Want to produce now? This generates {N} avatar clips via HeyGen and assembles with Remotion."

**If yes**: call `produceTimeline(config, slug)`. Report progress as clips generate. When complete, report:

```
Video rendered: {studioOutputs}/{slug}.mp4
  Avatar clips: {N} generated via HeyGen
  Text cards: {N} rendered
  Total duration: ~{duration}s

Next step: Open in CapCut to replace B-roll placeholders and add final polish.
```

Emit a `video_rendered` signal and log to session memory.

**If no**: report what was saved and how to produce later:

```
Timeline saved: {stories}/{slug}/timeline.md
  Shots: {N} ({avatarCount} avatar, {textCardCount} text cards, {bRollCount} b-roll)
  Duration: ~{duration}s
  Platform: {platform}

To produce later, run `/director-video {slug}` and choose "produce".
```

### Humanizer

Run a humanizer pass on all avatar script lines. No AI vocabulary (delve, landscape, crucial, leverage, robust, innovative). No filler phrases. Vary sentence length. Be specific. Preserve the user's voice from Voice.md.

Script lines should sound spoken, not written. Read each line out loud. If it sounds assembled rather than said, rewrite it.

## Story Folder Structure
